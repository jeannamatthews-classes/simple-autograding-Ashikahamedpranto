# Difference Between a Text File and a Markdown File

A **text file** (.txt) and a **markdown file** (.md) may seem similar at first, but they serve different purposes and have distinct features:

## 1. **Content**
- **Text File**: Contains plain text with no formatting options. Itâ€™s just raw text, and there is no support for things like headings, bold or italic text, or hyperlinks.
- **Markdown File**: Contains plain text as well, but it allows you to format the text using special syntax. You can add headings, bold or italic text, lists, links, images, and more.

## 2. **Use Cases**
- **Text File**: Best for storing raw data, notes, or any other form of unformatted text.
- **Markdown File**: Used primarily for creating documents with rich formatting that can be easily converted to HTML for web publishing. Markdown is commonly used for README files, documentation, and writing blogs.

## 3. **Syntax and Structure**
- **Text File**: No special syntax. Every character is just plain text.
- **Markdown File**: Includes formatting syntax such as:
    - `#` for headers
    - `**bold**` for bold text
    - `*italic*` for italic text
    - `-` or `*` for lists

### Example:

#### In a Markdown file:
```markdown
# My Header
Here is **bold** text and *italic* text.
